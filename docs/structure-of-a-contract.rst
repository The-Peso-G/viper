Structure of a Contract
#######################

Contracts in Vyper are contained within files, with each file being one smart-contract.  Files in Vyper are similar to classes in object-oriented languages.
Each file can contain declarations of :ref:`structure-state-variables` and :ref:`structure-functions`.

.. _structure-versions:

Versions
========

Vyper supports version pragma which is used to reject being compiled with future compiler versions that might introduce incompatible changes.

.. code-block:: python

    # @version ^0.1.0

The version pragma checks that the compiler version 0.2.x can not compile this file. The pragma checking uses `NPM <https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver>`_ semantic versioning syntax.

.. _structure-state-variables:

State Variables
===============

State variables are values which are permanently stored in contract storage. They must be declared at deployment (outside of any functions), and if not initialized they will take the corresponding :ref:`initial value<types-initial>` for their type. State variables are accessed via the :ref:`self<constants-self>` variable.

.. code-block:: python

    storedData: int128

See the :ref:`types` section for valid state variable types.

.. _structure-functions:

Functions
=========

Functions are the executable units of code within a contract.

.. code-block:: python

    @public
    @payable
    def bid(): // Function
        // ...

Function calls can happen internally or externally and have different levels of visibility (see
:ref:`structure-decorators`) towards other contracts. Functions must be explicitely declared as public or private.

Public Functions
----------------


Public functions (decorated with ``@public``) are a part of the contract interface and may be called via transactions or from other contracts. Public functions in Vyper are equivalent to external functions in Solidity.

.. code-block:: python

    @public
    def add_seven(a: int128) -> int128:
        return a + 7

A vyper contract cannot call directly between two public functions. If you must do this, you can use an :ref:`interface <contract_structure-interfaces>`.

.. _structure-functions-private:

Private Functions
-----------------

Private functions (decorated with ``@private``) are only accessible from other functions within the same contract. They are called via the :ref:`self<constants-self>` variable:

.. code-block:: python

    @private
    def _times_two(amount: uint256) -> uint256:
        return amount * 2

    @public
    def calculate(amount: uint256) -> uint256:
        return self._times_two(amount)

Private functions do not have access to ``msg.sender`` or ``msg.value``. If you require these values within a private function they must be passed as parameters.

.. _structure-decorators:

Non-reentrant Functions
-----------------------

The ``@nonreentrant(<key>)`` decorator places a lock on the current function, and all functions with the same ``<key>`` value. An attempt by an external contract to call back into any of these functions will cause a ``REVERT`` call.

Decorators
----------

The following decorators are available:

=============================== ===========================================================
Decorator                       Description
=============================== ===========================================================
``@public``                     Can only be called externally.
``@private``                    Can only be called within current contract.
``@pure``                       Does not read from contract state or environment variables.
``@view``                       Does not alter contract state.
``@payable``                    The contract is open to receive Ether.
``@nonreentrant(<unique_key>)`` Function can only be called once,
                                both externally and internally. Used to
                                prevent reentrancy attacks.
=============================== ===========================================================

The visibility decorators ``@public`` or ``@private`` are mandatory on function declarations, whilst the other decorators(``@view``, ``@payable``, ``@nonreentrant``, ``@pure``) are optional.

Default function
----------------

A contract can also have a default function, which is executed on a call to the contract if no other functions match the given function identifier (or if none was supplied at all, such as through someone sending it Eth). It is the same construct as fallback functions `in Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html?highlight=fallback#fallback-function>`_.

This function is always named ``__default__`` and must be annotated with ``@public``. It cannot have arguments and cannot return anything.

If the function is annotated as ``@payable``, this function is executed whenever the contract is sent Ether (without data). This is why the default function cannot accept arguments and return values - it is a design decision of Ethereum to make no differentiation between sending ether to a contract or a user address.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: python

    event Payment:
        amount: int128
        sender: indexed(address)

    @public
    @payable
    def __default__():
        log Payment(msg.value, msg.sender)

Considerations
**************

Just as in Solidity, Vyper generates a default function if one isn't found, in the form of a ``REVERT`` call. Note that this still `generates an exception <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Subtleties>`_ and thus will not succeed in receiving funds.

Ethereum specifies that the operations will be rolled back if the contract runs out of gas in execution. ``send`` calls to the contract come with a free stipend of 2300 gas, which does not leave much room to perform other operations except basic logging. **However**, if the sender includes a higher gas amount through a ``call`` instead of ``send``, then more complex functionality can be run.

It is considered a best practice to ensure your payable default function is compatible with this stipend. The following operations will consume more than 2300 gas:

- Writing to storage
- Creating a contract
- Calling an external function which consumes a large amount of gas
- Sending Ether

Lastly, although the default function receives no arguments, it can still access the ``msg`` global, including:

- the address of who is interacting with the contract (``msg.sender``)
- the amount of ETH sent (``msg.value``)
- the gas provided (``msg.gas``).

.. _structure-events:

Events
======

Events may be logged in specially indexed data structures that allow clients, including light clients, to efficiently search for them.

.. code-block:: python

    event Payment:
        amount: int128
        sender: indexed(address)

    total_paid: int128

    @public
    @payable
    def pay():
        self.total_paid += msg.value
        log Payment(msg.value, msg.sender)

.. _structure-metadata:

NatSpec Metadata
================

Vyper contracts can use a special form of docstring to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. This special form is named the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec).

This documentation is segmented into developer-focused messages and end-user-facing messages. These messages may be shown to the end user (the human) at the time that they will interact with the contract (i.e. sign a transaction).

Example
-------

Vyper supports structured documentation for contracts and public functions using the doxygen notation format.

.. note::

    The compiler does not parse docstrings of private functions. You are welcome to NatSpec in comments for private functions, however they are not processed or included in the compiler output.


.. code-block:: python

    """
    @title A simulator for Bug Bunny, the most famous Rabbit
    @license MIT
    @author Warned Bros
    @notice You can use this contract for only the most basic simulation
    @dev
        Simply chewing a carrot does not count, carrots must pass
        the throat to be considered eaten
    """

    @public
    @payable
    def doesEat(food: string[30], qty: uint256) -> bool:
        """
        @notice Determine if Bugs will accept `qty` of `food` to eat
        @dev Compares the entire string and does not rely on a hash
        @param food The name of a food to evaluate (in English)
        @param qty The number of food items to evaluate
        @return True if Bugs will eat it, False otherwise
        """

Tags
----

All tags are optional. The following table explains the purpose of each NatSpec tag and where it may be used:

============ ======================================== ==================
Tag          Description                              Context
============ ======================================== ==================
``@title``   Title that describes the contract        contract
``@licence`` License of the contract                  contract
``@author``  Name of the author                       contract, function
``@notice``  Explain to an end user what this does    contract, function
``@dev``     Explain to a developer any extra details contract, function
``@param``   Documents a single parameter             function
``@return``  Documents one or all return variable(s)  function
============ ======================================== ==================

Some rules / restrictions:

1. A single tag description may span multiple lines. All whitespace between lines is interpreted as a single space.
2. If a docstring is included with no NatSpec tags, it is interpreted as a ``@notice``.
3. Each use of ``@param`` must be followed by the name of an input argument. Including invalid or duplicate argument names raises a :func:`NatSpecSyntaxException<NatSpecSyntaxException>`.
4. The preferred use of ``@return`` is one entry for each output value, however you may also use it once for all outputs. Including more ``@return`` values than output values raises a :func:`NatSpecSyntaxException<NatSpecSyntaxException>`.

Documentation Output
--------------------

When parsed by the compiler, documentation such as the one from the above example will produce two different JSON outputs. One is meant to be consumed by the end user as a notice when a function is executed and the other to be used by the developer.

If the above contract is saved as ``carrots.vy`` then you can generate the documentation using:

.. code::

   vyper -f userdoc,devdoc carrots.vy

User Documentation
******************

The above documentation will produce the following user documentation JSON as output:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "methods": {
        "doesEat(string,uint256)": {
          "notice": "Determine if Bugs will accept `qty` of `food` to eat"
        }
      },
      "notice": "You can use this contract for only the most basic simulation"
    }

Note that the key by which to find the methods is the function's
canonical signature as defined in the contract ABI, not simply the function's
name.

Developer Documentation
***********************

Apart from the user documentation file, a developer documentation JSON
file should also be produced and should look like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "author": "Warned Bros",
      "license": "MIT",
      "details": "Simply chewing a carrot does not count, carrots must pass the throat to be considered eaten",
      "methods": {
        "doesEat(string,uint256)": {
          "details" : "Compares the entire string and does not rely on a hash",
          "params": {
            "food": "The name of a food to evaluate (in English)",
            "qty": "The number of food items to evaluate"
          },
          "returns": {
            "_0": "True if Bugs will eat it, False otherwise"
          }
        }
      },
      "title" : "A simulator for Bug Bunny, the most famous Rabbit"
    }

.. _contract_structure-interfaces:

Contract Interfaces
===================

An interface is a set of function definitions used to enable communication between smart contracts. A contract interface defines all of that contract's publicly available functions. By importing the interface, your contract now knows how to call these functions in other contracts.

Defining Interfaces and Making External Calls
---------------------------------------------

Interfaces can be added to contracts either through inline definition, or by importing them from a seperate file.

The ``interface`` keyword is used to define an inline external interface:

.. code-block:: python

    interface FooBar:
        def calculate() -> uint256: view
        def test1(): nonpayable

The defined interface can then be use to make external calls, given a contract address:

.. code-block:: python

    @public
    def test(some_address: address):
        FooBar(some_address).calculate()

The interface name can also be used as a type annotation for storage variables. You then assign an address value to the variable to access that interface. Note that assignment of an address requires the value to be cast using the interface type e.g. ``FooBar(<address_var>)``:

.. code-block:: python

    foobar_contract: FooBar

    @public
    def __init__(foobar_address: address):
        self.foobar_contract = FooBar(foobar_address)

    @public
    def test():
        self.foobar_contract.calculate()

Specifying ``payable`` or ``nonpayable`` annotation indicates that the call made to the external contract will be able to alter storage, whereas the ``view`` ``pure`` call will use a ``STATICCALL`` ensuring no storage can be altered during execution. Additionally, ``payable`` allows non-zero value to be sent along with the call.

.. code-block:: python

    interface FooBar:
        def calculate() -> uint256: pure
        def query() -> uint256: view
        def update(): nonpayable
        def pay(): payable

    @public
    def test(some_address: address):
        FooBar(some_address).calculate()  # cannot change storage
        FooBar(some_address).query()  # cannot change storage, but reads itself
        FooBar(some_address).update()  # storage can be altered
        FooBar(some_address).pay(value=1)  # storage can be altered, and value can be sent


Importing Interfaces
--------------------

Interfaces are imported with ``import`` or ``from ... import`` statements.

Imported interfaces are written using standard Vyper syntax, with the body of each function replaced by a ``pass`` statement:

.. code-block:: python

    @public
    def test1():
        pass

    @public
    def calculate() -> uint256:
        pass

You can also import a fully implemented contract and Vyper will automatically convert it to an interface. It is even possible for a contract to import itself to gain access to it's own interface.

Imports via ``import``
**********************

With absolute ``import`` statements, you **must** include an alias as a name for the imported package. In the following example, failing to include ``as Foo`` will raise a compile error:

.. code-block:: python

    import contract.foo as Foo

Imports via ``from ... import``
*******************************

Using ``from`` you can perform both absolute and relative imports. With ``from`` import statements you **cannot** use an alias - the name of the interface will always be that of the file:

.. code-block:: python

    from contract import foo

Relative imports are possible by prepending dots to the contract name. A single leading dot indicates a relative import starting with the current package. Two leading dots indicate a relative import from the parent of the current package:

.. code-block:: python

    from . import foo
    from ..interfaces import baz

.. _searching_for_imports:

Searching For Interface Files
*****************************

When looking for a file to import Vyper will first search relative to the same folder as the contract being compiled. For absolute imports, it also searches relative to the root path for the project. Vyper checks for the file name with a ``.vy`` suffix first, then ``.json``.

When using the command line compiler, the root path defaults to to the current working directory. You can change it with the ``-p`` flag:

::

    $ vyper my_project/contracts/my_contract.vy -p my_project

In the above example, the ``my_project`` folder is set as the root path. A contract cannot perform a relative import that goes beyond the top-level folder.

Built-in Interfaces
-------------------

Vyper includes common built-in interfaces such as `ERC20 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20>`_ and `ERC721 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721>`_. These are imported from ``vyper.interfaces``:

.. code-block:: python

    from vyper.interfaces import ERC20

    implements: ERC20

You can see all the available built-in interfaces in the `Vyper GitHub <https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/tree/master/vyper/interfaces>`_ repo.


Implementing an Interface
-------------------------

You can define an interface for your contract with the ``implements`` statement:

.. code-block:: python

    import an_interface as FooBarInterface

    implements: FooBarInterface


This imports the defined interface from the vyper file at ``an_interface.vy`` (or ``an_interface.json`` if using ABI json interface type) and ensures your current contract implements all the necessary public functions. If any interface functions are not included in the contract, it will fail to compile. This is especially useful when developing contracts around well-defined standards such as ERC20.

Extracting Interfaces
---------------------

Vyper has a built-in format option to allow you to make your own vyper interfaces easily.

::

    $ vyper -f interface examples/voting/ballot.vy

    # Functions

    @view
    @public
    def delegated(addr: address) -> bool:
        pass

    # ...

If you want to do an external call to another contract, vyper provides an external interface extract utility as well.

::

    $ vyper -f external_interface examples/voting/ballot.vy

    # External Contracts
    interface Ballot:
        def delegated(addr: address) -> bool: view
        def directlyVoted(addr: address) -> bool: view
        def giveRightToVote(voter: address): nonpayable
        def forwardWeight(delegate_with_weight_to_forward: address): nonpayable
        # ...

The output can then easily be copy-pasted to be consumed.
